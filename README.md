Cheater's Guide to Compiling with NuPIC's C++ Code (Without Python)

Numenta NuPIC is an open source project that models its algorithms on recent analysis of neocortex neurobiology.

The code is Python-centric but contains extensive C++ as well. Accessing it without the Python binding is not obvious.

It's actually quite simple to configure a build environment to link to the C++ libraries.

This Cheater's Guide is a description of what I did to build the setup I use with Linux and Gnu C++.
